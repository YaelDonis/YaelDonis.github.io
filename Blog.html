        <h2>Breaking News: Analysis of the school environment</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
        <p>In the last couple of years, the school environment has undergone a radical transformation driven by the rapid adoption of online classes. The global pandemic forced students and teachers to adapt to new ways of learning and teaching, which has generated a variety of experiences, opinions and reflections.</p>
        <div class="image-and-text">

            <p>For many, online classes offer convenience and flexibility, allowing students to tailor their study schedules to their individual needs. In addition, access to rich digital resources and the ability to participate from anywhere in the world have expanded learning opportunities. However, this transition has also presented significant challenges.</p>
        </div> 
        <p>Students and teachers have faced technological obstacles, such as unstable internet connections or lack of access to appropriate devices. In addition, the lack of face-to-face interaction can negatively affect the educational experience, diminishing the sense of community and intrinsic motivation to actively participate in classes.</p>
           
        <p>In this context, it is essential to explore the diverse experiences and perspectives of those who have participated in this new educational paradigm. For this reason, we have created a podcast where students will share their experiences, reflecting on the pros and cons of online classes, and offering ideas for improving this mode of teaching. Through their stories, we hope to get a more complete and enriching view of the impact of the digital school environment on contemporary education.</p>
